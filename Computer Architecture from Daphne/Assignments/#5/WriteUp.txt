ASSIGNMENT 5

Degree of Success: 90%

I have coppied 3 supported files from ~bill/cs305: masm_mrd, prom_mrd.dat, mic1 to run the program.
Simultaneously, I have used the IO_scan_two_numbers_asm.txt for reference.
Although I got the perfect result for in both cases of adding two integers and overflow, 
my program gets the infinite loop after printing out the correct results.
I have used the ASCII charts with the numoff(48) to convert the input numbers, sum of two numbers 
and print out the result. Besides, in order to get the accurate integer the user input, I keep
multiplying it by 10, and dividing the result by 10 to be able to print out the correct addition
of two numbers.
