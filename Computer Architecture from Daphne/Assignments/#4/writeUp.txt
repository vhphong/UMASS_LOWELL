ASSIGNMENT 4

Degree of Success: 100%

I have utilized the support from provided files in "bill" directory to do this assignment. 
I have used the file named "mic1symasm_nand_rshift.c" to create my masm C source file "hw4symasm.c"
with adding more three definitions of MULT, DIV, RSHIFT and three different cases for masm assembler.
I did the same with the flex source file "hw4symasm.ll" based on the provided code from mic1symasm.ll
and added more definitions for MULT, DIV and RSHIFT.

The microcode source file "hw4symasm.mc" needed to work harder with adding the microcode for MULT, 
RSHIFT and DIV; however, the majority are written in the provided files "microcode_nand_rshift.c" and
"mult_ucode.txt" in "bill" directory.

Also, I have created my own Makefile to compile all required files to run the program.
I have used 3 files a4_div_test.asm, a4_mult_test.asm and a4_rshift_test.asm to test the program.
