ASSIGNMENT 3

Degree of Success: 100%

I have created 2 arrays to store arguments to Fib and Fibonacci numbers of the argument 
values. The argument is pushed into the stack, and then decremented. For example, 
(arg-1) is decremented one to be (arg-2). The recursion calculates the Fib values and 
the values are stored in the accumulator (ac) to return

I have experienced the difficulty during doing this assignment. That was I did not know 
how to run the .asm file and where to download necessary tools. Eventually, based on the 
guides from Prof., the problem was solved.
