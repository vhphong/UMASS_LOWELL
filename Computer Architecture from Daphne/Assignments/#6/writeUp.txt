ASSIGNMENT 6

Degree of Success: 100%

I have used the file provided linker_partial.c for reference.
I have separated my code in assignment 5 into 7 different asm files: main.asm, xbsywt.asm, rbsywt.asm, readint.asm, 
writeint.asm, addints.asm, writestr.asm.
In result, I have built and run the linker program sucessfully.
Also, I have created the Makefile in order to save time and run the file easier.
I have used the masm_mrd, mic1 and prom_mrd.dat downloaded from ~bill/cs305.

Each object file was built by using the masm_mrd assembler with -o option.
Then, using the mic1 execution emulator to generate the executable file.
