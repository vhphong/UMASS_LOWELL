In this assignment, I use an input file named 'deer_in.png'. My program takes a seed with value is 01101000010100010000 and tap at the 16th bit.
My execution command is:
./PhotoMagic deer_in.png deer_out.png 01101000010100010000 16

After the program has executed, I get an output file named: deer_out.png
