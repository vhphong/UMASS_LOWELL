ASSIGNMENT 5 - WriteUp
Degree of Success: 100%

I downloaded three supported files from ~bill directory: masm_mrd, prom_mrd.dat, mic1. 
The downloading commands were the similar ways to the ones I did in Assignment 4.
My program is written base on the file COMP3050_Assignment5_IO_scan_two_numbers.txt for referencing.
I got five accurate results as running the code. The program yielded the results at no errors.
I use the ASCII table with numoff(48) for converting two numerical inputs before adding up.
