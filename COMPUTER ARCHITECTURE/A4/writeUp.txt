ASSIGNMENT 4

Degree of Success: 100%

I applied the support from provided files in /~bill directory to do this assignment. 
I used "mic1symasm_nand_rshift.c" to create my masm C source file "hw4symasm.c"
by adding more three definitions of MULT, DIV, RSHIFT and three different cases for masm assembler.
I did the same with the flex source file "hw4symasm.ll" based on the provided code from mic1symasm.ll
and added more definitions for MULT, DIV and RSHIFT.

The microcode source file "hw4symasm.mc" is needed to work harder by adding the microcode for MULT, 
RSHIFT and DIV; however, the majorities are written in the provided files "microcode_nand_rshift.c" and
"mult_ucode.txt" in /~bill directory.

Also, I created my own Makefile to compile all required files to run the program.
I used 3 files a4_div_test.asm, a4_mult_test.asm and a4_rshift_test.asm to test the program.
