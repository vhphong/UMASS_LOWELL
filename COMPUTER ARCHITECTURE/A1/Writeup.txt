ASSIGNMENT 1

Degree of Success: 100%

I have two arrays, mantissa and exponent, created in my assignment. 
  Mantissa array with size of 23 stores the bit values of the mantissa starts at index 12 ends at index 39.
  Exponent array with size of 8 stores the bit values of exponent starts at index 2 ends at index 10.
  Sign bit is located at index 0. It is 0 if positive and 1 if negative.
I use 0x%x to print out the floating-point in hex value.
I use %.6f to print out the floating-point with 6 decimals.

I spent 6 hours to finish this assignement with no hassle.
