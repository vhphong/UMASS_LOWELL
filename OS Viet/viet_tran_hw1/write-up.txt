I believe I have 100% success with this assignment. Using the provided code in Dr. Bill Lecture as well as the help files,I managed to display the info as needed. 
My program will create the parent and run the parents report.After that, it will create a child and report the child info.Then the child is looped infinitely until it gets the SIGTERM, at that point, my program will run A1 provided from Dr.Bill
