Homework 5

I finish 100% for this Homework.

In this Homework, based on the file assignment5_struct_data.txt, 
I created the file Ultility.h and implemented the actual Utility.c. 

Base on that i impliment 3 type of memory allocation :bestfit, firstfit and buddysys.

This is the command I used to run the executables: 

./p5 object size proj_data5 > output

where 
object can be:
first : firstfit
buddy : buddysys
best : bestfit

size:
1024 
512

Here are the output that I got, which is similar to the one provided in the pdf assignment5.pdf

algorithm		1MB		512KB
first fit		490		374
best fit		492		377
buddy system		465		328
