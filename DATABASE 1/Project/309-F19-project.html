 <u>Project Description:</u>
 </h3>
 <p>In this project, you will work on a Hospital Database which contains information of doctors, patients, nurses and tests.
   There are many doctors in the hospital; weâ€™d like to record their identification (ID), name, gender, age, phone
   number, address, years of experience and specialization. We also have patients, who have identifier (ID), name,
   gender, age, phone number, address, and disease information. Clearly, each doctor has a number of patients, and
   vice versa. A doctor is assisted by a number of nurses, for whom we record ID, name, address. Doctors perform tests over certain patients. A tests table stores information of patient on whom test
   is performed, the doctor who performed the test, and details of the test like the date of the test, its result
   (positive or negative).
    Download the database <q>Hostpital.accdb</q> from google group.
    Write SQL queries using MS Access and execute them.

 <h4>Database tables:</h4>
<em>
   DOCTORS (<u>D_ID</u>, D_NAME, D_GENDER, D_AGE, D_SPECIALIZATION,
        D_YEARS_OF_EXPERIENCE, D_CONTACT, D_STREET, D_CITY)</br>
  PATIENTS (<u>P_ID</u>, P_NAME, P_GENDER, P_AGE, P_DISEASE, P_CONTACT, P_STREET, P_CITY)</br>
  NURSES (<u>N_ID</u>, N_NAME, N_SPECIALIZATION, N_SHIFT, N_STREET, N_CITY)</br>
  P_ASSIGNMENT (<u>P_ID, D_ID</u>)</br>
  N_ASSISTS (<u>N_ID, D_ID</u>)</br>
  TESTS (<u>T_ID</u>, T_NAME, P_ID, D_ID, T_DATE, T_RESULT)</br>
</em>
<h4>Queries</h4>
<ol>
  <li>
    List all doctors' name whose contact number starts with "978".</br>
  </li>
  <p></p>
  <li>
    List all the doctors who are consulted by a patient names "RICHARD MILLER".</br>
    (Your result should display doctor's name.)<br>
  </li>
  <p></p>
  <li>
    List the nurse(s) who assist at least two doctors.</br>
    (Your result should display nurse(s)'s name.)<br>

  </li>
  <p></p>
  <li>
    Find the patients who had assignments with every doctor with specialization "Neurology".</br>
    (Your result should display patient's name.)<br>
  </li>
  <p></p>
  <li>
    List the doctors and the number of nurses they have, display in the descending order of the number.</br>
    (Your result should display doctor's name and the number of their nurses.)<br>
  </li>
  <p></p>
  <li>
    Find the doctor whose patients have the most different type of diseases.</br>
    (Your result should display the doctor's name.)<br>
  </li>
  <p></p>
  <li>
  List the city where the most number of doctors and nurses live in.</br>
  (Your result should display the city and the number.)<br>
  </li>
  <p></p>
  <li>
    Increment years of experience of all the doctors by 1.<br>

<h2>Materials to Turn In</h2>
   <p>
   Submit both MS Access file that contains the original database and
the queries and MS Word document that contains the queries and their
results by <font color="red">11:59PM, December 10th, 2019.</font><br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- On <i>cs.uml.edu</i>, use the submit command: <i>submit yli2 3090 Yourname_Hospital.accdb Yourname_Hospital.docx</i> (one submission per group)

   </p>
   <hr>
<h2>Things to remember</h2>
    <p>
    Your project must run correctly in the department's computer lab to receive credits.
    </p><p>All queries must be written using SQL interface in Microsoft access.
    </p><p>All queries should be implemented in the given order.
    </p><p>Late submissions will be taken off 50% and will not be accepted after 48 hours of original deadline.
    </p><p>Queries will be graded on correctness. Few points may be
deducted for bad style like use of complicated queries which are
difficult to understand.
    </p><p><b>Plagiarism is prohibited. If found, all the students involved will get zero credit for the project.</b>
