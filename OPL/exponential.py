# Naive Python program to print all combinations of k of n items.
# Runs in time O(2^n), regardless of k (this is terrible).

# Uses bignums to represent subsets of {1, 2, ..., n}:
# bit i (starting with 1 for the least significant bit) indicates
# that i is in the set.
# By running through all numbers from 1 to 2^n-1, we can consider all
# possible subsets.
