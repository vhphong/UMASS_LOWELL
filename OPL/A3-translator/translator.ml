(*******************************************************************
   This file ("translator.ml") provides stub functions for the extra
   code you need to write for this assignment.

   There are two major stub functions in "translator.ml":
   "ast_ize_P" (which transforms a parse tree for a program into
                an abstract syntax tree[AST]); and
   "translate" (which translates an AST into an equivalent C program).

   You are also being provided with a file called "parser.ml" which
   contains working code to produce a parse tree for a program.
   Everything in the file "parser.ml" is complete and usable as-is.

   The major entry point for the parser provided in "parser.ml" is
   a function called "parse" invoked with two parameters: A parse table,
   and a string containing a calculator language program.

   The file "parser.ml" constructs two example parse tables:
   "cg_parse_table" (for the original calculator language grammar), and
   "ecg_parse_table" (for the extended calculator language grammar).

   Here are two parser examples which will work as-is:

      parse cg_parse_table sum_ave_prog;;
      parse ecg_parse_table primes_prog;;
   		
   "sum_ave_prog" and "primes_prog" are provided at the end of this
   file (as strings). "sum_ave_prog" uses the original calculator
   language grammar, while "primes_prog" uses the extended calculator
   language grammar.

   When complete, your translator code should work when invoked as
   follows:

      print_string
        (snd
          (translate
            (ast_ize_P
              (parse ecg_parse_table primes_prog)
            )
          )
        );;
   	
   The result of this invocation should be a C program on standard
   output, which can be compiled and run to produce the first N primes
   (where N is a number typed by the user).

   Functions to translate an AST into C

(* The code below is (obviously) a bare stub. The intent is that when
   you run translate on a full, correct AST, you'll get back code for an
   equivalent C program. If there are any variables that are written in
   the program but never read, you'll also get a warning message
   indicating their names and the lines on which the writes occur. Your
   C program should contain code to check for dynamic semantic errors. *)
