I completed  all 4 objectives required by this assignment and removed debugging "predict" cout statement.

In the first part of the assignment, I translate the code provided by Professor from C into C++. The code compiles without errors under g++.

In the second part of the assignment, I extend the caculator language with if and do/check statements in the pdf file. we optimize the code by using switch statement instead of if statement. 

In the third part of the assignment, I implemented exception-based syntax error recovery by initialize 2 classes SyntaxErrorException and Syntax_error to catch any error for every functions.

In the last part of the assignment, I print the syntax tree using cout statments. The indent of few line are incorrect.
