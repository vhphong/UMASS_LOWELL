-------------------------
commands:
make
./parse < input.txt
I replaced all c style by c++ style syntaxes of two files "parse.cpp" and "scan.cpp".
I replaced gcc by g++ in the Makefile to be able to run on c++.
Then I compiled the codes with no errors popped out.
I added commands into the two files which corresponding to the names[] elements.
I had SyntaxErrorException and Syntax_error classes implemented 
to try-catch any exceptions from each funtion.
