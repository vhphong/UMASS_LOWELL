Final Project Checkpoint
The Ant’s Nest
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
AStar.cs
    Showing the principle of the A* algorithm to be built-in the project.

Cons.cs
    Constructs the map with programmable coordinates can be used for the path control of the objects such as the ant, bricks, and leaves.

Coordinate.cs
    Calculates the distance of two any points related to the project. Mainly used for computing the distance that the ant has to travel.
        
MapManager.cs
    Considered as the core class and function of the project. It contains those functions:
    MapManager(): 	Computes the path of the ant, which consisted of many of cells considered as nodes.
					Therefore, the path is a stack of nodes, which can create a MoveList for the ant follows.
                    The nodes (cells) which are used (passed) can be deleted based on stack technique.
                    Establishes the initial and the final points of the path. Then calculates the optimal way to travel.

Node.cs
	Function MakeLink(ref Node node) makes a linked list of nodes to create a path.
