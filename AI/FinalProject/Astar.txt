What is A* Search Algorithm?
A* Search algorithm is one of the best and popular technique used in path-finding and graph traversals.

Why A* Search Algorithm ?
Informally speaking, A* Search algorithms, unlike other traversal techniques, it has “brains”. What it means is that it is really a smart algorithm which separates it from the other conventional algorithms. This fact is cleared in detail in below sections.
And it is also worth mentioning that many games and web-based maps use this algorithm to find the shortest path very efficiently (approximation).



// A* Search Algorithm
1.  Initialize the open list
2.  Initialize the closed list
    put the starting node on the open 
    list (you can leave its f at zero)

3.  while the open list is not empty
    a) find the node with the least f on 
       the open list, call it "q"

    b) pop q off the open list
  
    c) generate q's 8 successors and set their 
       parents to q
   
    d) for each successor
        i) if successor is the goal, stop search
          successor.g = q.g + distance between 
                              successor and q
          successor.h = distance from goal to 
          successor (This can be done using many 
          ways, we will discuss three heuristics- 
          Manhattan, Diagonal and Euclidean 
          Heuristics)
          
          successor.f = successor.g + successor.h

        ii) if a node with the same position as 
            successor is in the OPEN list which has a 
           lower f than successor, skip this successor

        iii) if a node with the same position as 
            successor  is in the CLOSED list which has
            a lower f than successor, skip this successor
            otherwise, add  the node to the open list
     end (for loop)
  
    e) push q on the closed list
    end (while loop)
