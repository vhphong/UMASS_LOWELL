Programming Assignment 1

I used Python programming language to write this program assignment.
It is a challenge for me to write it in this programming language, especially writing the dfa file
and input file with valid and invalid input strings.
I have faced with some errors when debugging the program, for example determining which version of
python I should use (version 2 or 3) and Python normally displays the line of causing errors but not
specific error. 

The input string is read from stdin, and the assignment works with these following commands:
    ./dfa -d m1.dfa < m1.in
    ./dfa -d m1.dfa < m1.in > m1.out
    cat m1.in | ./dfa -d m1.dfa

Also, I tried to work on extra credit for supporting json definition for machine, reading machine
defined in json and output json for machine definition in verbose mode
