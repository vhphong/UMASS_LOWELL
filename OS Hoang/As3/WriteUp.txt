DEGREE OF SUCCESS: 100%

I think my degree of success for this assignment is 100%.
I got all the code from the call_help_assign3.txt from Professor website.

I created 4 files: donuts.h, utilities.c, proddonuts.c, consdonuts.c that also work with the Makefile from the website without any errors. I can print out the output normally after I compiled the code and ran the shell file.

I also provide the graph of the deadlock and Queue size. As I see on the graph, the queue size around 45 would produce 50% chance of the deadlock. The lower queue size, the higher chance of geting deadlock

Also, the higher number of consumers, the higher the chance of deadlock because there is only one producer.
