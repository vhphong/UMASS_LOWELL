Homework 5

DEGREE OF SUCCESS: 100%

WriteUp:
I have finished this assignment with 100% success.
I have utilized all the codes from the Assignment_5_data_structs.txt for references from Professor.
Also, I have used the proj5_data file downloaded from bill/cs308 to support the assignment.

Run command line: "make run" to execute these lines:
	./main bestfit 1024 proj5_data.txt > best1024Results.txt
	./main firstfit 1024 proj5_data.txt > first1024Results.txt
	./main buddysys 1024 proj5_data.txt > buddy1024Results.txt
	./main buddysys 512 proj5_data.txt > buddy512Results.txt
	./main firstfit 512 proj5_data.txt > first512Results.txt
	./main bestfit 512 proj5_data.txt > best512Results.txt

Then I have gotten the results as expected.
I am able to implement the allocation requests and memory free operations for the best fit, buddy system
and first fit linked lists.
Sometimes, we get segmented problem or killed, but it can be easily fixed by trying to re-run "make run".
