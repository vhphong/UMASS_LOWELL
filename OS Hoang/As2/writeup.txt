Assignment 2
Degree of Success: 100%

In this assignment, I found some help from my 1st assignment and some slide provided by professor. I believe that my code fullfilled all the requirements of this assignment. 

In "sort.c", I sorted the data by area code and print out the results of people having the same area code using the command: ./Sort cs308a2_sort_data
In "grep.c", I counted how many lines that including string "123" and return the result by the command: ./Grep cs308a2_grep_data_1
                        ./Grep cs308a2_grep_data_2

Grep1 took very fast to execute. However Grep2 , running on the 2nd data set, took forever to run since the data of the file is too large.
