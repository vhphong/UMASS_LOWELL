WriteUp:
I have finished this assignment with 100% success.
I have utilized all the codes from the call_help_assign4.txt for references from Professor.

I have divided the codes into 2 files: pc_threads.h and pc_threads.c.
The Makefile used to run and clean the project.

I have written modify loop in producer function to pthread_cond_signal and pthread_mutex_unlock to unlock producer
and lock consumer. Then, I have created codes in consumer function to determine deadlock, terminate somaphores and
print out the value of PID as well as other related values as types of donuts.

First test: Queue Size vs Percentage of deadlock
I ran the shell script with the header file set to 50 consumers and 30 producers with a hard coded value of 200 donuts.
Then, I have varied the Queue Size setting for testing. I have figured out that the 50% Queue Size is set between
26700 and 26800.

Second test: Donutes Created vs Percentage of deadlock
I ran the shell script with the 50% queue size. Then, I have varied the amount of donut dozens, starting with 100
and then going up to 300. As the result, the higher amount of donuts, the higher percentage of deadlocks.

The results excel files and graphs are also attached with the assignment.
