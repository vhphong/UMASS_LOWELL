ASSIGNMENT 2

Degree of Success: 100%

I think my code meets the requirements from the assignment.

I utilized some parts from assignment 1 and professor's reference to
complete this assignment.

For sort.c file, I sort the cs308a2_sort_data file by area code, then print out
the sorted result with code number and number of people found in the data.
For grep.c file, I print out the number of lines returned by grep searching
any line that has the string "123".

The result shows that there are 23 lines returned by grep for grep_data_1.
However, we can not print out the result for the file name grep_data_2 because
of the size of the file.
