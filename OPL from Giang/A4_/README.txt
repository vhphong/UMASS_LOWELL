I believe I was able to finish this assignment 100%. It was pretty
straightforward, I just had to implement the pointer class given the
template in the pdf and I even created a tombstone class as well
following what the book wanted us to do. I also created test cases
that you can run also. To run the tests, you must compile the tests
using the 'make test' command provided the Makefile. From there,
you can individually run each test case with the following cmds:

./test1.o
./test2.o
./test3.o
./A4-tests.o
