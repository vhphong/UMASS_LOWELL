This assignment currently is only able to run the code that was initially given by the
professor. I've translated it to C++ and that's as far as I got with this assignment.
It's still a work in progress, and I intend on finishing it later.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So this is my second resubmission with most of the work added into it. I pretty much followed
the assignment leaving off from where I translated everything to C++, and I extended the grammar.
I also implemented the exception-based syntax error recovery based on how the example slides did it
in class, and attempted to output a syntax tree. I couldn't really figure out how to go about adding
indentation to the syntax tree, and I've come close to perfecting the syntax tree, but there exists
some errors that make it incomplete such as incorrect identifiers being placed in some areas.

To run the assignment, simply type "make test" and it will build the parser and also run it using
the code from prime.cl stored in a file called "test.txt".
