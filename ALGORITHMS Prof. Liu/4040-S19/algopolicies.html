<h2><center>Policies</center></h2> <p align="justify"><b>Homework
Format Policy</b>:  It is recommended that homework be
typed. Handwritten submissions will lose points if handwriting is
difficult for the TA to read.  A paper copy must be submitted.
Rationale must be given for each answer.  Algorithm descriptions must
include pseudocode, correctness justfication, and complexity analysis
(typically asymptotic running time). Partial credit for wrong answers
is only given if work is shown.  <p align="justify">

<b>Late Policy</b>:  Homework is considered late if submitted <b> after 
5pm on the due date</b>. Under normal conditions late assignments will
not be accepted.   In extenuating circumstances, a student who
wishes to request an extension must notify the instructor prior to
the assignment's due date (or exam date).   

<p align="justify"><b>Academic Honesty Policy</b>:  Students are
expected to honor all CS department and UMass Lowell policies related
to academic honesty and integrity.  Violators risk failing the course
in addition to any actions taken by university administration.  The default CS department policy is that a student who cheats will fail the course. The University's policy is described <a href = "http://www.uml.edu/catalog/undergraduate/policies/academic_dishonesty.htm"> here. </a> All
work on exams must be the student's own work. All work on homework
assignments must also be the student's own work, with the following
exceptions: 1) hints provided by the instructor or TA may be used but
must be acknowledged in writing in the student's work; 2) high-level
hints from another student may also be used if a student is unable to
make progress on an assignment problem on his/her own; this type of
hint must also be acknowledged in writing in the student's
work. Detailed collaboration among students on homework assignments is not permitted. Students cannot obtain homework answers from web sites.
