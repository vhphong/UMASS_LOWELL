    Homework

Homework assignments will be posted on this page weekly. They will be in
Microsoft Word format. [Important: View them in page/print layout mode
to be sure to see all the graphical symbols! In "normal" mode some
symbols will be missing in some web browsers.]

Students are reminded of the academic honesty policy on our course's web
site. An honor statement must be signed and submitted with each homework
assignment. An electronic copy of the honor statement is here. <honor.doc>
