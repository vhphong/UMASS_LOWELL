I have successfully completed al objectives set out in the project description file. 
I have split the project into two files. The first part can be run like this:

python project_part1.py

Running the first part should not take long(around 2-3 minutes at most)

For the 2nd portion of the project
There are 2 versions that I have for the CELF portion of the project. 

One has the progress bar output and one does not.I included the progress bar dependency 
because it was taking so long to run and I needed to see the progress on each part 
of the code

To run the script without progress bar, use the command:
python celf_no_progress_bar.py

Running the 2nd part should not take long either, around 3 minutes on the CS server
was my last benchmark

To run the script with the progress bar, virtualenv needed to be installed first
!!You cannot do this on CS server since it requires root to install virtualenv!!
Please follow the following commands:

pip install virtualenv(CS server won't allow this!!!)
virtualenv . --system-site-packages(create a local environment within current folder inheriting global python packages)
source ./bin/activate(activate the enviroment)
pip install -r requirements.txt(install dependencies listed in the txt file)
python celf_progress_bar.py
deactivate(go back to regular shell)

I could have zip up my entire virtualenv folder but I find that very invasive.
You might not be as interested in finding out what is the deal with progress bar
so I leave the choice to you!
Thanks for reading and grading my work. 
I hope you have a great summer!
