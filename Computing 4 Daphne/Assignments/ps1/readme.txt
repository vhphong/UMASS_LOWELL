#Name: Dangnhi Ngoc Ngo		In this assignment, I have created two projects: Sierpinski triangles and Original. With these recursive graphics, I take two arguments: recursion depth (the number of times the graphic repeats) and the side of the window.	To Sierpinski triangles, I created a big triangle in the center of the window (depth = 0), and then when depth = 1, I continue to create a triangle inside with 3 points, respectively, in the mid points of the first triangle's each side. After that, the program provokes function sierpinski_tree which creates 3 other triangles (tri1, tri2, tri3) and uses recursion.	To Original graphic, I created a recursion of a hexagon. First of all, I draw a big yellow hexagon in the center of the window, and then keep drawing smaller hexagons inside. Each inside hexagon has the points lying the mid point of the bigger hexagon's side. Besides, I have used random color for each inside hexagon.	In my perspective, the hardest about this project is determining the coordinates of each point for each shape.  With this Original graphic, it is fun that you are free to create whatever shape you like and give a lot of filters for them.	I have spent 18 hours to complete this assignment.
