#Name: Dangnhi Ngoc Ngo	I have created two windows to display input and output image. The program takes 4 arguments from command line as below:./PhotoMagic decode.png encode.png 01101000010100010000 16where first and second argument is input and output image respectively      third argument is a string of seed      last argument is tap positionThe function createOutput() uses seed and tap position (LFSR) to encrypt the input image by XOR bitwise operator. The output image is saved in the file named as second parameter
