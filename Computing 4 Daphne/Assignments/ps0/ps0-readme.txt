Books, documents, discussion forums, Internet are the various resources most people find easy to use for free references as well as seeking for ideas. Therefore, it is not hard for us to read electronic books, papers uploaded online without authors’ authorization, utilize unreliable resources and apply them to our academic exercises or take the efforts from another without their permits, make up the data and turn it into our work. /********************************************************************** *  List whatever help (if any) you received from TAs, the instructor, *  classmates, or anyone else. **********************************************************************/None/********************************************************************** *  Describe any serious problems you encountered.                     **********************************************************************/None/********************************************************************** *  List any other comments here.                                      **********************************************************************/Additional feature:
I have created the sprite for my assignment and tried to make it move in 4 directions with 4 arrow keys on the keyboard (Left, Right, Up and Down). In each different direction, the sprite would change its position which is appropriate to that direction.
Besides, I use the code “setRotation” to make the sprite rotate 45 degrees.
