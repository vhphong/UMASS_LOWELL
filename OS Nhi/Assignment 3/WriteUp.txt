Homework 3

DEGREE OF SUCCESS: 100%

I have finished this assignment with 100% success.
I have utilized all the codes from the call_help_assign3.txt for references from Professor.

The provided Makefile can run and clean the project by compiling these following files:
donuts.h, utilities.c, proddonuts.c, consdonuts.c.

In consdonuts.c, I have provided some functions to determine deadlocks, terminate somaphores and print out PID values.
In proddonuts.c, the infinite loop is the producer for ID value and shared ring flavors.

I ran the shell script with loops set to 5 (5 consumers and 1 producer).
From the results excel and graph which shows the relation between the depth of queue size and the probability of
deadlock, the distribution is linear. At queue size 10, the deadlock is 100% and decreases to 0 from queue
size 70, 80, 90 to 100.

The queue size around 45 (between 40 ahy 50) would produce a 50% chance of deadlocking.

Result: the higher number of consumers, the higher the chance of deadlock occurs.

The results excel file and graph are also attached with the assignment.
