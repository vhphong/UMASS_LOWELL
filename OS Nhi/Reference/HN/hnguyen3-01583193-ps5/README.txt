	+ Since I have gotten the results as expected. I think I finish this assignment 95% except sometime we get segmented problem on the buddycall (Re-run "make run" will solve the problem -- I don't know why but it does the trick)
	+ The code I have taking from professor's file help structure for assignment 5 and implement the functions as required in the assignment. I got help from TA and professor Moloney and online resources to be able to finish the assignment.
