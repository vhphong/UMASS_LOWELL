  Assignment 3                              
*******************************************************/

- I think I finish the assignment with 100% satisfying all the requirements from Professor Moloney.

- First, I created up a list of files structure by splittedup the code from assgn3-call-help file in his website.
	+ donuts.h
	+ proddonuts.c
	+ consdonutes.c
	+ utilities.c
	+ Makefile

Naming condition I complete followed the template for variables and Makefile for filename.

- After, I write a infinite loop in proddonuts.c as a producer to product value of ID and shared ring flavor.
- I also then created some functions in consdonuts to determine deadlock, terminate somaphores and then print out the value of PID and some related values as type of donuts.

Note: In the result file, I include only the data of c1 file to demo but did not inlcude the other 4 files due to the messy of each file may confuse the TA.

Graph of percentage of deadlock depends on the size running also included.
