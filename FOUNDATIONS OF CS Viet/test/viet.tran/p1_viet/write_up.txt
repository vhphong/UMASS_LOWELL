DFA Implementation
	Overall, I think I completed 100% of this assignment. I decided to program this in Python. 
	This is a new language to learn for me because I have no experience with Python. 
	However, I found that Python is easier to implement this program rather than C or C++.
	It was really a hard program for me especially where we have to check possible errors 
	such as command line argument parsing, valid definition file, valid input string etc. 
	That was the hardest part for me, and it was a real challenge. Running in Python is easier, 
	but it is more difficult to debug the program. When I ran it, it only shows us the line number 
	but it doesn’t really tell us what the errors are. 
	I found it to be a challenge to implement in Python and import JSON file as input. 
	I was having difficulty understanding when I looked the simple output in the pdf file. 
	However, as I keep working on it, I understood the objective.
	I finished implementing the “Interactive Run” feature and the “Use of Pipe and Redirection” feature.
	Even though the python commands is quite different from 
	“./dfa –d m1.dfa <m1.in”, “./dfa –d m1.dfa <m1.in >m1.out”, and “cat m1.in | ./dfa –d m1.dfa”
	 please reference the readme.txt located inside each folder.
